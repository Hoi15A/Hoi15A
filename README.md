# Hi! <img height="32px" src="https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5f242b241ab9be446c4def65/3x">

You seem to have reached my profile!

On GitHub I store most of my little side projects, most of which are not serious/professional at all and/or inside jokes with some friends.
If you have any questions about any of my projects feel free to reach out using issues or other means.
Most of my projects also have [free software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-software_license) attached so feel free to build upon them if you feel like it.

I also have a website at [neat.moe](https://neat.moe) however do note that it is currently out of date.


### And that's basically it
